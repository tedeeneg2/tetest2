All authentication endpoints (/api/auth/signup, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me) are functioning correctly. Bcrypt compatibility confirmed - no issues found."

    message: "Complete job board backend testing completed successfully. All requested endpoints tested: ✅ Authentication (signup, login, token verification) ✅ Job endpoints (list jobs, create job, get specific job) ✅ Role-based access control (employers can post jobs, candidates cannot) ✅ Integration test (complete flow from employer signup to job posting and verification). Fixed minor issue with employment_type enum values during testing. All 19 tests passed with 100% success rate. Backend API is fully functional and ready for production use."
